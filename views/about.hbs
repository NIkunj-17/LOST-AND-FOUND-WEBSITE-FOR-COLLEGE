            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>Welcome to the Lost and Found platform of IIIT Raichur college. Our platform aims to facilitate the process of reporting lost items and reuniting them with their rightful owners.</p>
            <p>If you have lost an item within the IIIT Raichur campus premises, you can use our platform to report it. Provide details about the lost item such as its description, when and where it was lost, and any other relevant information.</p>
            <p>Similarly, if you come across a lost item and wish to return it to its owner, you can use our platform to report it as found. Provide details about the found item and our system will match it with reported lost items to help facilitate the return process.</p>
            <p>We strive to create a community-driven platform where users can help each other by reporting lost items and assisting in their return. Together, we can make a difference and contribute to a more connected and supportive campus environment.</p>
            <p>For any inquiries or assistance, please feel free to <a href="/contact">contact us</a>.</p>
